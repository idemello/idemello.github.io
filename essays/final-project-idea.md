â€“ UH parking based on map of where to go in general area, within 0.5 miles
- If user has pass, can input will change map for user

## Overview

The problem that we are trying to solve is the difficult situation presented by UH parking and their broken website. Parking on campus or even in Manoa has proven to be difficult with many tow-away zones, vague parking rules, and an aggressive UH parking ticketing staff. Our solution is an interactive map where the user could click on a specific area on campus or in the nearby area and our app would display when they will be able to park, if permits are required, if there is a cost associated with the area, or if they are unable to park there. If the user has a permit they will be able to add it to their profile so that they will see a different availability of parking than a user with no permits. Ex: Users with any UH permit can park (almost) anywhere on campus on Saturday.
## Mockup page ideas
-public landing page
-login page
-user home page 
-admin home page
-user profile page
-user map page w/ time specifier 
-admin map page

## Case Ideas

- New user goes to a landing page, which contains basic information about the app, they can either login or set up a profile.
- Admin goes to landing page, logs in, get home page, edits site.
- User goes to landing page, logs in, and a map is displayed, admin can edit information about the page.
