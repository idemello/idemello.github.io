## Starting from the Bottom

This was one of the more difficult modules of the semester in my opinion. The module was broken down into two weeks. The first week was a brief introduction into HTML and CSS, easy enough. All that was required was completing a simple  tutorial online. Working with HTML was simple, although if you don't organize your code it can be a visual nightmare that is hard to maintain. CSS on the other hand, even from the beginning was problematic. Small changes to margins caused drastic changes throughout the entire document resulting in backtracking and constanly making minor tweaks.  

 In one of our practice WOD's we were required to format a navigation bar at the top of the page. This quickly went from an easy assignment to a frustrating nightmare. After completing 90% of the assignment the only task left was to create the nav bar. This had varying results, none of which were desirable. Elements would quickly space themselves out dramatically, or even misalign each other with the simplest changes to their classes. In the end what I thought would be a simple practice assignment ended up being a time consuming exercise in frustration.  
 
## A Matter of Semantics  

Learning a UI framework is a gigantic step in the process of learning a new language. It takes principles you know and uses them in an entirely new way. While not as difficult as learning an entirely new programming language, learning the different keywords and tools available is a very long process. The more I use the keywords, the more comfortable I am with Semantic. That being said all the work that was done within this framework was condensed into a very short time period. While I am starting to get used to the framework, it was a very hectic week.  

On the bright side the documentation for Semantic UI, is very well written and much easier to navigate than the Java documentation. Once I knew what to look for I had very little trouble finding the necessary sections that were needed to improve my mock websites. To make this even more appealing the tools necessary to do things that would be very difficult using pure HTML/CSS are incredibly simple with this UI framework. Creating functional dropdown menu's, social media icon's, visually appealing formats can be done very quickly using the tools provided by Semantic UI.

## Not Back to Basics  

So why did we invest so much time and energy in learning this UI, instead of using pure HTML and CSS? After working with Semantic for only a few hours it was very apparent how powerful of a tool this was. In the first week we took around 25 minutes to create a rather plain webpages. After learning semantic however, we were capable of recreating very visually appealing mock websites of local clothing companies, bars, etc. I'm actually really excited to use Semantic UI in the future to create websites for my own uses.
