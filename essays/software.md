To me software engineering represents the ability to start from scratch and create something very powerful. Whether the creation is an app that entertains, a program that collects data from a satelite, or a simple flashlight on one's phone; software engineering allows us to take ideas and make them a reality. 

One of the reasons I enjoy programming and as a corollary, software engineering is that it allows you to be creative in a very unorthodox way. If someone handed me a paintbrush or any classic artisitic medium, I would not be able to make something that is considered "creative". With programming it allows you to be creative using logic and mathematics, which do not fall under the classic umbrella of creativity. I find that aspect of software engineering amazing. The fact that you can see a simple problem, say for example the WOD we did as a class on Thursday where we needed to count the number of 1's, 3's and 5's in any given string. While there are many ways to solve this problem. For every solution, there is another method, another syntax, another way to solve the question at hand. This extends to almost any problem software engineering, and is something that can be applied to any aspect of life.
