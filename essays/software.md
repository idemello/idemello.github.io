## Why?

To me software engineering represents the ability to start from scratch and create something very powerful. Whether the creation is an app that entertains, a program that collects data from a satellites, or a simple flashlight on one's phone; software engineering allows us to take ideas and make them a reality.  
 
One of the reasons I enjoy programming, and as a corollary, software engineering is that it allows you to be creative in a very unorthodox way. If someone handed me a paintbrush or any classic artistic medium, I would not be able to make something that is considered "creative". With programming it allows you to be creative using logic and mathematics, which do not fall under the classic umbrella of creativity. I find that aspect of software engineering amazing. The fact that you can take a simple problem, say for example the WOD we did as a class on Thursday where we needed to count the number of 1's, 3's and 5's in any given string. While there are many ways to solve this problem. For every solution, there is another method, another syntax, another way to solve the question at hand. This extends to almost any problem software engineering, and is something that can be applied to any aspect of life. 
 
## Future Plans and Goals
  
In the present I hope to develop a strong understating of JavaScript, so that I can easily finish these WOD's in Rx time. Looking further ahead, I would like to focus on learning to manage my time better when it comes to programming. Even though I know it's more effective to code in five 3-hour blocks, as opposed to a single, frantic, fifteen hour coding nightmare, I still tend to end up closer to the latter. Although I am greatly improving in this area. I hope to learn a lot of valuable skills during my time as a software engineering student, and hopefully as a software engineer in the future. There are many valuable concepts to be learned in this class that will apply to a future career in the field. Namely, working together with other programmers to create larger programs, learning the business/copyright side of software engineering, and learning the small minute details that can make all the difference in a career setting.  

Because I have only taken introductory classes for computer science, I have not had much experience working with other programmers on projects. This is something that I am equally dreading and looking forward to. Team dynamics are ever-changing and impossible to predict, and with the amount of social interaction in computer science courses, I enjoy the group work that we have done so far. A very overlooked aspect of a computer science degree is what goes on outside of the math, the coding, and the projects. Learning the business side of how things work such as copyright, open-source, or even how different software actually turn profits is very important to our success as software engineers. I am looking forward to all that this class has to offer.
