## First Impressions

I started programming a little over a year ago, with the C language. C taught very important lessons about programming syntax, the command line, and memory management among other vital concepts. I also learned the litany of errors that can occur from the smallest mistakes. Taking that restrictive nature into Javascript, I have been pleasantly surprised by the leniency that exists within the language. Being able to declare all datatypes with simply let or const (and unfavorably var), is extremely convenient and allows coding to feel much more creative than analytic.  Upon further reading of the language the unrestrictive nature continues with cases where functions can easily be arrays, objects can be created using {}, and all the useful functions that existed within Java translate easily.

## In Relation to Software Engineering

From my limited perspective of the language, I believe that Javascript is an excellent language for software engineering. Because of the unrestrictive nature of the language a team could easily work on different blocks of code and combine their functionality later without worrying about negative interactions. 

## On Athletic Programming

I love all forms of competition whether itâ€™s sports, videogames, trivia, or even competing against oneself in an activity such as running. With athletic programming I am given the ability to not only compete against a clock for different outcomes, but I can compete against myself to see where I stand as a programmer in expectation vs. reality. In this way, I can benchmark myself and improve as much as possible. I really enjoy the WODs they not only force me to practice to stay sharp, but they create a situation where I am looking to study more than normal to get the Rx times.
