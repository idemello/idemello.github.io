# The Importance of a Good Question

In any professional field there exists a learning curve essential for progress toward a final goal. Whether that goal is a software engineering project, home improvement, or solving a mathematical proof, there is (usually) an experienced source of knowledge in that field. In the current day and age where forums and message boards exist for nearly any subject, getting the most out of our resources can greatly speed up the learning process and help us to overcome obstacles. In this week's experience "Reflect on smart questions" we learned why how you structure your questions can make all the differences. 

# [LMGTFY](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=How+to+ask+questions+the+smart+way) 

Although the essay is titled *How To Ask Questions The Smart Way* authors Eric Steven Raymond and Rick Moen go into detail about how to ask questions the wrong way as an example of what *not* to do when you are seeking answers. The authors talk about how asking questions with obvious faults such as poor grammar, punctuation, lack of courtesy, etc. will lead to your question being answered with as much care as the question, if it is answered at all.  
More importantly however the authors acknowledge the fact that as learners we all make mistakes, and how to recover and learn from those experiences. The section, wonderfully titled as "*On Not Reacting Like A Loser*" ,  focuses mainly on accepting that someone telling you that you messed up is not out of hatred for you. Rather that person is doing that for you to learn more and to protect their community.  The best thing to do in the scenario is to accept it, be thankful and learn. The worst thing that you could do is respond with vitriol and dig a deeper hole for yourself. 

# The Right Way  

So how does one ask questions the right way? First and foremost, asking a good questions requires research. Going straight from bug to forum will yield terrible results. Instead taking the necessary time to browse FAQs, message boards, and other resources will allow you to ask a more informed question. Next it is very important to find the right place to ask your question. Asking JavaScript questions in a Unix forum will be obviously ignored, and asking your question to many boards at the same time will have the same result.  
In the question itself there is even more that you must be wary of. While there are too many facets cover extensively the most important topics for me were "Describing problems in chronological order" and "Following up with a brief note on the solution". Something that I am guilty of is not paying attention to the order in which events happen when I am coding, especially when I am getting frustrated with an error. When "static variable cannot be referenced from a static context" I don't care about what happened before,  I want to know how to fix the present error. This in turn may lead to more future errors that are difficult to fix. Following up with a brief note on the solution is something that I wish all forum users would do. How many times have we searched a question and found the exact query, only to find the words "Fixed it. Thanks!". This type of follow-up can help everyone in the community, and the authors go on to say "this sort of good follow-up behavior is actually more important than conventional politeness" 

# Exhibit A  

[If an element already exists in an array, don't add it again](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41364383/if-an-element-already-exists-in-an-array-dont-add-it-again) This question demonstrates many of the principles required for a smart question. First the questioner demonstrates that they have tried many different attempts and solving the problem. How they attempted that problem, and the current results. The answers to this question are very detailed, and the page shows 10 different possibilities for the questioner to use.

# The Alternate Approach 

[I cant upload PDF files, can anyone help me with it?](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/41888399/i-cant-upload-pdf-files-can-anyone-help-me-with-it) This question has several faults according to the essay. First off, the question comes off as near groveling and reeks of desperation. Secondly the user simply pastes his code without any attempt at solving the problem. This essentially asks the others users to dissect their code for him. The answers to this question are reflective of what the essay details. In fact there is only a single response to the question "What error are you getting". This is a very small sample size, but it is very telling that following the guidelines of the essay can lead to much better results.
