When most people think of software engineering a lot of different prerequisites come to mind. Whether it is mastering many different languages or working with a large team, software engineering is a complicated process with many moving parts. One of the most important parts that is often overlooked s is the very powerful concept of configuration management. Even from my limited time as a programmer gitHub has proven to be an invaluable resource. 
 
I have not had the (mis)/fortune to work on a coding project with a large group of people. In fact, I have never programmed anything with more than two other partners. However, this does not mean I have not seen the power and utility of git and gitHub. Several times during my Java courses I was forced to revert to a previous commit, because I broke my code in an way that was difficult to detect. If not for git I would have spent an indeterminate amount of time finding and changing little details within my code. 

I have yet to experience difficulties in a project due to lack of configuration management. Then again, I have never worked with a very large team on a project to date. I can see that when there is a large team working on a project, and many people are committing many different snippets of code at the same time, being able to control where and what revision is used can be very powerful. In the same vain knowing how to use git/gitHub is a skill that will benefit us all greatly. Because so many software engineering projects rely on both of these services. Being able to confidently work with our own repositories and not pushing things directly to the master branch are skills that most companies expect in this day and age.
 
# gitHub vs. git 
## Chicken or the Egg for Nerds 
  
While many people may think that git and gitHub are one in the same they are actually very different. git is an open source version control system, where as gitHub is an online web hosting service for repositories. So even though the two go hand in hand the question must be asked which of these two made the other one popular? In my opinion git is popular because of gitHub. GitHub has given pepole a very good reason to use git. Before the advent of gitHub there existed many different forms of configuration management as discussed in this modules' screencast. However, since I have come into programming I have never heard of another configuration management cloud being used nor another version control system. I think that this is because of the success and widespread use of gitHub.
