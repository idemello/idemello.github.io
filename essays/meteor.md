## One Small Step for Man

<img class = "ui large image" src = "http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2012/08/26/article-2193737-14B2A689000005DC-359_964x635.jpg"> 

This has been the month where everything we have learned thus far has been combined into a set of challenging modules. The basis of all these modules has been the JavaScript framework Meteor. I will say that I have gone through the motions of learning Meteor, and It has been incredibly frustrating. However being able to build a visually appealing interactive website has been something I have wanted to do for a long time. Being so close (hopefully) to that point has pushed me through the difficulties of the previous weeks.

From the beginning of the Meteor modules we were given a small template and were prompted to build off of various meteor tutorials. Even at the tutorial level there was so much information, and I will admit I felt very lost. Even after spending hours reading and practicing, I still could not get a grasp of Meteor. However, with a final goal in mind I pressed on. 

## Meteor

The bulk of the Meteor modules were performed in the second and third weeks. This was done over an assignment called digits. Digits was a simple web app that allowed user to add, edit, and eventually delete contacts. At first digits was simple enough, all that was required was to create a table and add pages. From there, much like everything else in this class, the difficulty scaled exponentially. We went from adding tables and headers to creating functioning buttons, adding, editing, and removing entries this was not as simple as I expected.

Conversely, Meteor does provide a very simple way to connect your entire web page, and even after completing only the digits tutorials I was able to clearly see the functionality and some of the capabilities of Meteor. Looking further ahead, a lot of powerful tools exist online for Meteor, I have found forms, map interfaces, and much more that I haven’t discovered. I think that once I get my JavaScript skills to the right level, I will really enjoy the capabilities of Meteor. 

## Armaggedon

So having a small grasp of the basics of Meteor what is next for the students of 314? A lot. There is so much more and we’ve barely scratched the surface of the capabilities of meteor.  Which is both exciting and terrifying. To be able to create a fully functioning website that can achieve something that we’ve planned out represents a whole new world of possibilities. In that regard I am very excited, but to be honest I am much more terrified of what lies ahead. Because on top of learning meteor to the necessary degree, we need to do this while coordinating with group members, setting up a group repo (hopefully we don’t destroy each other’s code), and deploying it to this crazy thing called galaxy. So at this point it’s me vs. Meteor, I hope I have better luck than Bruce Wills and crew.
